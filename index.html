The Abu Simbel temples are the two massive rock temples situated near the village in Nubia of southern Egypt. 
It was constructed by the Egyptian king pharaoh Ramasses II.
 It was dedicated to the Sun Gods of Ancient Egypt known as Sun Gods Amon-Re and Re-Horakhte. 
 The temple has been in the abandoned state for a very long period of time, 
 later it was rediscovered by Swiss orientalist Jean Louis Burckhadt.

It was built in the period 1264 B.C and 1244 B.C. At the entrance of the temple, it has 69 ft. 
huge statues of Ramasses II. The hall other temple has been constructed in such a way that it will remain connected to the inner chambers of the temple. 
The temple is planned and constructed in such a way that the Sun rays will light the statues of the Sun Gods on every 22nd February and 22nd October. 
This is one of the unique features of the temple.

The great Abu Simbel temples were constructed by Ramses the Great (1279-1213 BCE) which began in 1264 BC till 1244 BC taking 20 full years which was dedicated to the gods Ra-Horakty, the deified Ramesses II (The Great Temple) Ptah, and the goddess Hathor and Queen Nefertari. It was known as “Temple of Ramesses, Beloved By Amun” and built to two main reasons, the first was for the glorifying and immortalizing his victory and accomplishments and the second was to showcase his love for his beautiful wife Nefertari. The temple was rediscovered after being buried under the sand for a long time in 1813 by Swiss explorer John Lewis Burckardt who was led to the site by an Egyptian Nubian boy called Abu Simbel. The sand was entirely removed off the temple in 1909 to become one of Egypt’s most incredible attractions.
